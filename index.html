    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Going digital. <br><br>Everything is digital these days, and eventhough there are a plethora of existing platforms where websites can be built and email templates can be created, they never express exactly what you envisioned as the end-result. Building a website, or creating an email-template from scratch, changing and adapting it as your business changes and adapts, is essential when trying to stay relevant.</p>
    <p>There is a constant need to create something that is unique while still expressing relevant (and ever changing) ideals and idiologies. This in turn neccessitates everyone and everything to adapt and stay relevant as the world around us changes.</p>
    
    <p>This reality is the reason why my philosphy in everything I do is:</p>
    
    <p><strong>&#8226; Keep on Learning &#8226; Adapt &#8226; Stay Relevant &#8226; Be Indispensible </strong></p>
